# StockMarketSim
Stock market simulator

This simulator includes a trading account that tracks balance and stock holdings that mimics the stock market movements. It will also mimic the queue of requested trades that is resolved periodically in bulk batches in order of trade placements.

This project will involve the following:
- Inheritance
- Queue
- Random number generation for simulations
- Compsite Objects
- An algorithm that allows stocks to trend in one direction to avoid chaotic up/down every turn

What I learned: 
- Creating instance variables
- Using inheritance from Account class
- Using array for stock positions
- Storing pending stock trade in queue until execution
- Using constructors
